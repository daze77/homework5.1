# Word Day Scheduler


This application was designed to to showcase the use of local storage by implementing a day planning that can save data to the the local storage and retreive that information upon refresh to display it onto the page. 

The original intent was to use JQuery, which was done is some of the code, but we relied on knowledge of JavaScrip for the most part.

Information can be entered into any of the time blocks and once the save button is pushed, the information is saved to the browsers local storage.  Upon refresh or releading of the page, the last saved information will be populed into the time blocks.  This is the case even if the browers is shut down and restarted. 

In addition, the time blocks are color coded.  Anything past the current time will color code to grey, the current time to red and future time slots in green.  As the hours progress, the color coding of the time slots will update (upon refresh or save) to reflect the current state.
